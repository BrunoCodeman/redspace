# Redspace

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4. 

## Development server (how to run)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Please, user `master` branch.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## PS:
I tried to publish the code at [Heroku](https://redspace-angular.herokuapp.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://brunocodeman.github.io/redspace/), but for some reason `ng build` is addint a "t" character in the middle of the URL so unfortunatelly it's only working when you run locally.
